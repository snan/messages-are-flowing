* =messages-are-flowing=

If you're writing an email in Emacs, and the recipient reads it on
their phone, chances are it's going to look like this:

[[./non-flowed.png]]

If you use =messages-are-flowing=, it will hopefully look like this instead:

[[./flowed.png]]

This works by distinguishing "hard" and "soft" newlines while writing
the message.  As shown in this screenshot, hard newlines are
designated with "‚èé":

[[./hard-newline-in-buffer.png]]

The "flowed" text format is described in [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2646][RFC 2646]].

** How to use it

Install =messages-are-flowing.el= with =M-x package-install-file=, and
then add the following to your =.emacs= file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq mml-enable-flowed t)
(add-hook 'message-mode-hook 'messages-are-flowing-use-and-mark-hard-newlines)
#+END_SRC


#+STARTUP: showall
